AMR IN CANCER: ANTIBIOTICS Cancer patients have weakened immune systems, which makes them especially susceptible to bacterial infections. Antibiotics are therefore essential in the management of these illnesses. But the effectiveness of these life-saving medications is coming under more and more danger from the expanding problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR in cancer patients is a complicated issue since their medications frequently compromise their immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infections and making treatment decisions more difficult. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer can weaken the immune system, which raises the risk of infections (Kanj & Kanafani, 2023). Antibiotics must be used in order to successfully manage infections because of this increased risk. However, the rise in resistance bacterial strains has been largely attributed to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in clinical settings, particularly oncology (Hsu et al., 2022).Antibiotics must be used in order to successfully manage infections because of this increased risk. However, the rise in resistance bacterial strains has been largely attributed to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in clinical settings, particularly oncology (Hsu et al., 2022). Because these resistant strains are more challenging to treat, hospital stays are lengthier, healthcare expenses are higher, and fatality rates are higher. Recent studies demonstrate how seriously AMR affects cancer patients. According to a 2023 study that was published in \*JAMA Oncology\*, infections brought on by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) were linked to a noticeably increased risk of death in cancer patients when compared to infections brought on by bacteria that were susceptible to antibiotics (Smith et al., 2023).In order to regulate antibiotic usage more wisely, this research emphasizes the critical need for efficient antibiotic stewardship programs in oncology settings. A vital tactic in the fight against AMR is antibiotic stewardship. According to Friedman et al. (2023), this strategy entails eliminating needless antibiotic use, optimizing dosage regimens, and choosing the right antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity data. Stewardship for cancer patients needs to be customized to meet their individual needs, taking into account things like the kinds of infections they are susceptible to and the particular cancer treatments they are receiving. To combat resistant infections, there is an increasing emphasis on stewardship in addition to the development of novel antibiotics and complementary therapies. To combat current resistance mechanisms, research is being done on new antibiotics and combination treatments (Ventola, 2023).Reducing the frequency of illnesses and lowering the need for antibiotics partly depends on preventive measures like vaccinations and better infection control procedures. In conclusion, the emergence of AMR poses a serious threat to the effectiveness of antibiotics, even if they are still necessary for treating infections in cancer patients. A multimodal strategy, combining strong antibiotic stewardship, novel therapy development, and improved preventive measures, is needed to address this dilemma. By putting these tactics into practice, the medical community can ensure that antibiotics remain useful tools in the treatment of cancer while also improving the management of AMR. \*\*REFERENCE\*\*Friedman, N.
